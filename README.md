LinkFixerBotSnr™
===============
**LinkFixerBotSnr ( abbreviated LFBSnr )** stands for Link Fixer Bot Senior. This bot is a fill in for [/u/LinkFixerBot2](http://www.reddit.com/user/LinkFixerBot2) until it can get back up and running fully. There is nothing really much to it.

**Note:** LFBSnr is not 24 / 7, due to the fact that I do not have a dedicated 24 / 7 server at my disposal. But I try to keep him up and running most of the time.
